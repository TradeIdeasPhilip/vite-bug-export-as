# `export as` in *.d.ts vs Vite

This project shows off [a problem in Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/7964).

I originally found the problem when I tried to `import { TextBufferGeometry } from "three/examples/jsm/geometries/TextGeometry.js"`.
My program worked perfectly when I was using `TextGeometry` instead of `TextBufferGeometry`.

After digging around some, the problem appears to be in Vite.
Vite fails when a *.d.ts file uses `export as`.  

When I write a file in TypeScript I can use `export as` just fine.
The problem appears when there is a *.js file and a corresponding *.d.ts file. 

I get the same results when trying to access a file in ./src as I do for a file in an npm import.

I created this project is a minimum way to reproduce the problem.

According to `tsc` and VS Code, there are no errors in this project.

When I run `npm run dev`, that command shows no errors.  However, when I try to run the program in a browser, I see the following error in the JavaScript console and my code will not execute.  `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/some-library.js' does not provide an export named 'runMeAlias' (at main.ts:4:1)`

When I try to build this project for production I immediately see an error message:
